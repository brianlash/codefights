# Last night you had to study, but decided to party instead. Now there is a
# black and white photo of you that is about to go viral. You cannot let this
# ruin your reputation, so you want to apply box blur algorithm to the photo
# to hide its content.
#
# The algorithm works as follows: each pixel x in the resulting image has a
# value equal to the average value of the input image pixels' values from the
# 3 Ã— 3 square with the center at x. All pixels at the edges are cropped.
#
# As pixel's value is an integer, all fractions should be rounded down.
#
# Example
#
# For
#
# image = [[1, 1, 1],
#          [1, 7, 1],
#          [1, 1, 1]]
#
# the output should be boxBlur(image) = [[1]].
